# About Me

<!-- <img src="https://rhu2xx.github.io/ronghu.jpg" class="floatpic"> -->

Hi there! My name is **Rong Hu (Ronnie, 胡蓉)**, and I am a PhD student at Hunan University, advised by Professor [Wangdong Yang](https://csee.hnu.edu.cn/people/yangwangdong) and [Kenli Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mSpHqSUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra). I am also a visiting student at the University of Cologne, collaborating with Professor [Ziyue Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q5_My2AAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra).

My research focuses on GPU-accelerated computing, tensor decomposition, and LLM compression to enhance efficiency in large-scale AI systems. I develop scalable algorithms for tensor-based optimization, sparse computations, and deep learning model compression.

If you're interested in tensor methods, parallel computing, or LLM compression, feel free to reach out!

## Research Interests

- Tensor Decomposition
- Parallel Computing & GPU Acceleration
- High-Performance Computing (HPC)
- Large Language Model (LLM) Compression
- 
My current research focuses on optimizing large-scale AI models through efficient tensor computation and GPU-accelerated algorithms. I am particularly interested in LLM compression, sparse tensor methods, and scalable parallel computing to enhance the performance and efficiency of deep learning systems. Ultimately, I aim to contribute to the development of high-performance AI solutions that are both computationally efficient and widely accessible.
